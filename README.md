# Webscraper to python

Tool for converting exported as JSON [web scraper](https://github.com/ispras/web-scraper-chrome-extension) sitemaps to python classes.

## Usage:
  - Export sitemap
  - Copy and save to file
  - python ./main.py -i **[ input ]** -o **[ output file ]**
 
## Disclaimer:
Currently, this tool doesn't support all features of web scraper and it  (probably) never will because the purpose is to simplify and speed up the process of extracting data from HTML, leaving business logic up to the developer.
